cttv
minimal twitch.tv terminal frontend

This program is an attempt at a bare minimum frontend to twitch.tv, as said
website requires huge amounts of Javascript to work _at_all_, slowing down any
web browser you might be using to view the website. To do that, the program
uses youtube-dl to pipe the stream into your favourite video player.
Which is what should be used to play a video, rather than a text document
viewer that went out of hand.

You will need to configure a video player to use this program unless you use
mpv which is default. This can be done by either editing the source code
definition of the macro VPLAYER or setting an environment variable VPLAYER to
said player. The video player must accept standard input by means of the hyphen
character as an argument.

The file read is just a plain text file with one channel name per line.
Take care not to have any preceding or trailing whitespace.
